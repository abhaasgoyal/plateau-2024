\subsection{Post-study survery questions for Study Designs}
\begin{enumerate}
    \item How useful do you think capabilities are?
    \item How much did you like working on Wyvern? 
    \item How much did you like working on Rust?
    \item How much did you think you understand the concept of capabilities?
    \item What are some things that you would have wanted to improve in the survey if you had the chance to do it all over again? 
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{FileIO in Wyvern}

\begin{minted}{rust}
import fileSystem.BoundedReader
import fileSystem.Writer
import fileSystem.RandomAccessFile
import fileSystem.BinaryReader
import fileSystem.BinaryWriter
resource type File
    effect Read
    effect Write
    effect Append
    def makeReader(): {} BoundedReader
    def makeWriter(): {} Writer[{this.Write, this.Append}]
    def makeAppender(): {} Writer[{this.Append}]
    def makeBinaryReader(): {} BinaryReader
    def makeBinaryWriter(): {} BinaryWriter
    def makeRandomAccessFile(mode : String): {} RandomAccessFile
\end{minted}
